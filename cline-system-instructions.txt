This is a flutter application.
A music application.

The flutter project uses getIt, riverpod, go_router and CLEAN architecture.
It has it's theme config so never overwrite it.

DO NOT override any sensitive code. Do not even bother asking for permission.
Files like sonara.dart and router.dart have themeing and routing configurations respectively.
You have no write or permission to make any subtraction in those files. And DON'T fucking change my code. 

I've implemented song listing using Method Channels.
I also implemented features to store high quality thumbnails in application support directory.
While songs are being loaded and initialized in the splash screen, their thumbnails are being saved to the app's support directory.


When a song is clicked, a mini player appears first and a music notification is posted.
When the mini player is clicked, user is directed to a song screen.

I've added song searchning (filtering).

I've integrated playlist features using a hybrid approach.

Check the logic and architecture for creating, exporting and importing playlists.
Check the logic and architecture of loading songs, playlists & thumbnails (artworks).
Check the logic and architecture of playing songs, as well as displaying notifications of those songs.
Check the logic and architecture of the mini player.


Check all the code files to understand the current state and mechanism used in the app.
